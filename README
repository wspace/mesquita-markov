Hello!

I have developed a Markov Algorithm simulator in Whitespace.
Since Markov Algorithms are Turing-complete, I belive this proves that
Whitespace is also Turing-complete :-)
I'm sending an attached zip file containing:
   * The commented source code in "Whitespace assembly"
   * The WS that was generated from this assebly
   * An input file that contains a Markov Algorithm set of rules to test
if a string containing only "a" and "b" is a palindrome.

Cheers,
Leonardo Mesquita
